# 16S-23S-rDNA-database

This database contains sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA encoding region downloaded from the NCBI database and from a recently published study [Benítez-Páez, A.; Sanz, Y. Multi-locus and long amplicon sequencing approach to study microbial diversity at species level using the MinIONTM portable nanopore sequencer. Gigascience 2017, 6, 1–12, doi:10.1093/gigascience/gix043.].
Two files i) the taxonomy dump file (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/, accessed on 20-09-2017) and ii) the lineage file (https://github.com/zyxue/ncbitax2lin/, accessed on 20-09-2017) were used to get the lineage (taxonomy) for each specific
bacteria. The mapping database was created using the merged taxonomy text file and its corresponding sequencing multiple FASTA file. 

The database contains 23,439 sequences from 2389 species (295 sequences were not identified at the species level and could represent new species) and 896 genera.
